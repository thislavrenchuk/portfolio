#### HI, I'M ANA

        <span class="pb-0" style="text-align: justify;">I graduated with a Computer Science degree from University of Surrey, and currently reside in London.
            <br><br>I always held a firm belief that games are an unsurpassable tool for connecting with other people. Be it playing a game solo to then spread the word to your friends and relive the experience vicariously, gaming with siblings or friends in front of the TV, or playing online co-op with people miles and miles away. And that's not all. Games are an incredible resource for the fundamental fact that pretty much nothing is impossible. You can imagine, create, and do everything. 
            <br><br>Which is how I ended up studying Computer Science at the University of Surrey. I came out with solid technical skills and the desire to put my skills to do some good. I made my first entry into the FinTech world, far from the Gaming Industry I craved to be a part of, but which at the time seemed to be the right move. I learned many useful skills, such as teamwork, leadership and delivering projects from start to finish.
            <br><br>Having reached a senior position after four years, I was placed on projects as an Associate Team Lead on my team. I regularly made technical design decisions and oversaw key deliverables, working to high quality. I became comfortable translating design specifications into technical solutions and compiling detailed reports. I also learned to write clear and concise documentation and am always open to feedback.
            <br><br>I am a good collaborator and have worked with several teams spanning multiple projects. Having become well-versed in Agile and accustomed to joining ongoing projects I can adapt to changing project requirements and teams with varied specialisations and technical backgrounds. I am always committed to building good, lasting relationships with my team and encourage regular knowledge sharing and good documentation practices.
            <br><br>Outside of my professional career, I pursued my creative passion for games and game design by working on personal projects using Unreal Engine 5, working both with C++ and visual scripting. Through this, I have gathered a good understanding of various development concepts such as level design, gameplay mechanics, AI and narrative development.
