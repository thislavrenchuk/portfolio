#### HI, I'M ANA

<div class="col-sm-12 row justify-content-between">

        <span class="pb-0" style="text-align: justify;">üìåI graduated with a Computer Science degree from University of Surrey, and currently reside in London.
            <br><br>I always held a firm belief that games are an unsurpassable tool for connecting with other people. Be it board games or video. Be it playing a game solo and spreading the word to your friends, gaming with siblings and friends in front of the TV, or playing online co-op with strangers miles away. Games are a tool for connecting. <i>And that's hardly all</i>. Games are an magical resource for the fundamental fact that pretty much nothing is impossible. You can imagine, create, and do <i>anything</i>. 
            <br><br>Which is how I ended up studying CompSci with a budding dream of joining the gaming industry. I came out with solid technical skills but missed the left turn and ended up on a side-quest in a FinTech engineering job upon graduation. Go figure.
            <br><br>Far from the industry I craved to be a part of, I nonetheless did not waste my time and learned many useful skills. I became a big team-player, dipped a toe in leadership and learned the ins-and-outs of delivering big projects to even bigger deadlines. After four years, I reached a senior position and acted as the Associate Team Lead on my last few projects. I regularly made technical design decisions (more on that in my CV) and oversaw team deliverables, always striving to high quality. And dare I say, I now love writing documentation!
            <br><br>However, I still craved to one day return to my life's "main objective" and carve myself out a career in gaming. I started by working on personal projects using Unreal Engine (4 and 5), working both with C++ and visual scripting. I took inspiration from a wide range of my favourite games - starting with the big blockbuster beasts like TLOU and AC, to smaller titles like What Remains of Edith Finch and Untitled Goose Game. Aside from playing and making games, I greatly enjoy movies, hiking and travelling to new places (so am very open to rellocation üó∫Ô∏è).
