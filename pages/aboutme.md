#### HI, I'M ANA

        <span class="pb-0" style="text-align: justify;">I became interested in working in games while studying Computer Science at university.  I began learning by designing platformer games in Unity in the summers between my studies and playing many games to form my opinions and discover the type of gameplay I enjoyed and would want to create. I often drew inspiration from books and movies and enjoyed the process of building up stories and themes and helping these instruct the gameplay I'd create. 
        <br><br>After graduating and getting my first job, I continued working on personal projects, this time using Unreal Engine (4 and 5), working with both C++ and visual scripting. Here, I took further inspiration from my favourite games - blockbusters like TLOU and AC, as well as indie titles like What Remains of Edith Finch and The Stanley Parable. 
        <br><br>Whilst learning the game design fundamentals at home, I also picked up many useful skills during my 4 years of employment in the FinTech industry in London. I became a big team player, dipped a toe in leadership and learned the ins and outs of delivering projects to strict deadlines. I regularly made technical design decisions and oversaw team deliverables, always striving for high quality.
